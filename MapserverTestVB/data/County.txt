  Description
    Abstract:
      This is an ArcView shapefile of State-wide county boundaries
      for Oklahoma State. 
    Purpose:
     This county boundary data set was prepared to provide information about the county 
      boundaries within Oklahoma State as provided by 2000 TIGER/Line files of the Census
      Bureau. The TIGER/Line data for the individual counties was transformed 
      into an ArcView shape file for the entire Oklahoma State.
